Week 1 was pretty simple! Almost the same what we did in OOP244.
Just a revision of OO concepts: inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation.
Know about stack and heap and relate it with object creation with and without using "new" keyword.
Example: Stack: int a[10]; Heap: int a= new int[10];
Compilers and Linking we already know!
Read well about internal and external linkage and relate with WEB222 classes(inline CSS).
Declaration: forward and one line.
Global scope, use of "static" and "const".
Static: Can be applied to variables as well as functions. 
Static variable: initialised once and can be used anywhere throughout module and doesn't lose its value till you exit the application. Ideal Use: Suppose you want to keep a track of how many times a function is called or how many objects have been created.
Static functions: Doesn't need any object to get called. Simply use the name anywhere you want!
*Note* You can only use static variables in static functions.
Know about volatile qualifier. It's pretty fussy, you may skip. :D
Anonymous namespaces, classes, unions and structs.
*New Stuff*
Command Line Arguments(Check workshop 1 for details)
Static Assertion.

That's All! Thanks for viewing.
