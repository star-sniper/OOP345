THIS APP REQUIRES ARGUMENTS FROM COMMAND LINE. TO BE HONEST EVEN I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SUPPLY ARGUMENTS FROM COMMAND LINE TO XCODE

Method 1: JUST SIMPLY BUILD THE APPLICATION WITHOUT ANY ERRORS (WARNINGS DOESN'T MATTER) AND THERE YOU'LL SEE A LINE LIKE

Command Line blah blah blah that is your path to the xcode debug directory.

COPY THAT WHOLE PATH STARTING FROM '/' TILL THE END AND PASTE IT TO ACTUAL MAC TERMINAL. AFTER THAT GIVE A SPACE AND SUPPLY YOUR ARGUEMENTS.

Example: ..../ws1 IBM SUN ORC

Method 2: Inside Your XCODE project(the application) at the top left corner you'll see options to Build, Stop, Executable filename

Something like: ws1 > my mac

Click on that executable file and then Edit Scheme

Inside the Argument Passed on Launch option click on + option and add desired arguments.
 
Simply Run the program and enjoy!

WASN'T IT EASY PEASY AND LEMON SQUEEZY
