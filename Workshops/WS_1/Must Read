/*
NOTE FROM DEVELOPER

THIS APPLICATION WAS ORIGINALLY CREATED ON MAC OS SIERRA v 10.12.6 AND I USED XCODE AS AN IDE

CHEERS TO ALL MAC USERS

GOOD LUCK

THIS APP REQUIRES ARGUEMENTS FROM COMMAND LINE. TO BE HONEST EVEN I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO SUPPLY ARGUEMENTS FROM COMMAND LINE TO XCODE
THE SOLUTION IS: JUST SIMPLY BUILD THE APPLICATION WITHOUT ANY ERRORS (WARNINGS DOESN'T MATTER) AND THERE YOU'LL SEE A LINE LIKE

Command Line blah blah blah that is your path to the xcode dubug directory.

COPY THAT WHOLE PATH STARTING FROM '/' TILL THE END AND PASTE IT TO ACTUAL MAC TERMINAL. AFTER THAT GIVE A SPACE AND SUPPLY YOUR ARGUEMENTS.

Example: ..../ws1 IBM SUN ORC

WASN'T IT EASY PEASY AND LEMON SQUEEZY
