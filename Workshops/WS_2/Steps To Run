You all are very lucky to get these steps. It took me almost a week to know how to supply file
arguments through command line. Enjoy!!!

Note: Don't just copy! Try to understand the program and make variations, it wasn't that tough, though
enum class is new its simple if you're able to implement the concept practically.

The following steps are meant for Mac Terminal(same as we do in SSH client while doing the submission):

--> Open the Mac Terminal.
--> Change your directory to where all your cpp's and h's are present.
--> Type the command: g++ -o w2 -std=c++0x *.cpp 
This will compile all cpps and create a new executable file "w2"
--> Next, type the command: ./w2 Stations.dat
You are actually supplying the arguments and this is the data file. 
The above command will run your program.
